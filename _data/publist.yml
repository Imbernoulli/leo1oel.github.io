  abstract: â€œA novel deep learning  technique called Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is adapted to study steady groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers. This technique utilizes information from underlying physics represented in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) alongside data obtained from physical observations. In this work, we consider the Dupuit-Boussinesq equation, which is based on the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation, as well as a recent more complete model derived by Di Nucci (2018) as underlying models. We then train PINNs on data obtained from steady-state analytical solutions and laboratory based experiments."

  abstract: The TBM-constructed rock tunnel often suffers from low comparability of efficiency between geological condition detection and the TBM real-time operation requirements. This article developed a time-related intelligent model for tunnel lithology prediction using TBM construction big data with illustration by the Yinsong Water Diversion Project. The global attention mechanism based long-short-term-memory (LSTM) network was established to model the cyclic TBM construction data and make predictions of lithology at the tunnel face with 9 selected featuring input parameters. The established global-attention-mechanism-based LSTM network was found to predict well tunnel lithology with TBM construction data and outperformed the conventional LSTM network and other models in accuracy and F1-scores. The results could help the TBM drivers to adjust the operational parameters at real time for high-efficient tunnel construction. With implementation of the establish model into the TBM operational system, we will develop intelligence construction mode for the long TBM-constructed hard rock tunnels.
