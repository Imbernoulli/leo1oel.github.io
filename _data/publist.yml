  abstract: "The fifth-order finite-volume WENO-C reconstruction scheme is proposed for structured grids in cylindrical coordinates to achieve high order spatial accuracy along with ENO transition. A grid independent smoothness indicator is derived for this scheme. For uniform grids, the analytical values in cylindrical-radial coordinates for the limiting case (R → ∞) conform to WENO-JS. Linear stability analysis of the present scheme is performed using a scalar advection equation in radial coordinates. Several tests involving smooth and discontinuous flows are performed, which testify for the fifth-order accuracy and ENO property of the scheme."

  abstract: "High order reconstruction in the finite volume (FV) approach is achieved by a more fundamental form of the fifth order WENO reconstruction in the framework of orthogonally-curvilinear coordinates, for solving the hyperbolic conservation equations. The derivation employs a piecewise parabolic polynomial approximation to the zone averaged values to reconstruct the right, middle, and left interface values. The grid dependent linear weights of the WENO are recovered by inverting a Vandermode-like linear system of equations with spatially varying coefficients. A scheme for calculating the linear weights, optimal weights, and smoothness indicator on a regularly- and irregularly-spaced grid in orthogonally-curvilinear coordinates is proposed. A grid independent relation for evaluating the smoothness indicator is derived from the basic definition. Finally, the procedures for the source term integration and extension to multi-dimensions are proposed. Analytical values of the linear and optimal weights, and also the weights required for the source term integration and flux averaging, are provided for a regularly-spaced grid in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. Conventional fifth order WENO reconstruction for the regularly-spaced grids in the Cartesian coordinates can be fully recovered in the case of limiting curvature. The fifth order finite volume WENO-C (orthogonally-curvilinear version of WENO) reconstruction scheme is tested for several 1D and 2D benchmark test cases involving smooth and discontinuous flows in cylindrical and spherical coordinates."

  abstract: "Engine unstart is generated with the aid of thermal choking due to impulsive heat addition inside the combustor. The generated pressure disturbance traverses upstream inside the isolator duct in the form of normal shock, resulting in a loss of thrust and possible in flameout of the engine. A quasi-one-dimensional adaptation of mass, momentum and energy conservation equations of compressible flow with an appropriate heat release model is employed to investigate the flow physics inside the Scramjet in the case of starting and unstart conditions. Finally, a single-input-single-output (SISO) mechanism based on pressure feedback is proposed to avert this plaguing problem. Pressure enhancement in the upstream propagating normal shock is blown down with the aid of modeled bleeding mechanism. The effectiveness of controlling unstart inside the isolator is further analyzed with varying bleed-length and bleeding efficiency."
