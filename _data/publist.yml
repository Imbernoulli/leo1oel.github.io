  abstract: "High order reconstruction in the finite volume (FV) approach is achieved by a more fundamental form of the fifth order WENO reconstruction in the framework of orthogonally-curvilinear coordinates, for solving the hyperbolic conservation equations. The derivation employs a piecewise parabolic polynomial approximation to the zone averaged values to reconstruct the right, middle, and left interface values. The grid dependent linear weights of the WENO are recovered by inverting a Vandermode-like linear system of equations with spatially varying coefficients. A scheme for calculating the linear weights, optimal weights, and smoothness indicator on a regularly- and irregularly-spaced grid in orthogonally-curvilinear coordinates is proposed. A grid independent relation for evaluating the smoothness indicator is derived from the basic definition. Finally, the procedures for the source term integration and extension to multi-dimensions are proposed. Analytical values of the linear and optimal weights, and also the weights required for the source term integration and flux averaging, are provided for a regularly-spaced grid in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. Conventional fifth order WENO reconstruction for the regularly-spaced grids in the Cartesian coordinates can be fully recovered in the case of limiting curvature. The fifth order finite volume WENO-C (orthogonally-curvilinear version of WENO) reconstruction scheme is tested for several 1D and 2D benchmark test cases involving smooth and discontinuous flows in cylindrical and spherical coordinates."

  abstract: "The advent of nanotechnology in medicine has allowed to eliminate the toxic excipients that are often necessary to formulate lipophilic drugs in clinics. An example is paclitaxel, one of the most important chemotherapeutic drugs developed so far, where the Cremophor EL has been eliminated in the Genexol and Abraxane formulations. However, the complex procedures to synthesize these formulations hamper their cost-effective use and, in turn, their distribution among the patient population. For this reason, a simplified method to formulate this drug directly at the bed of the patient has been adopted. It requires only the use of a syringe and it starts from a native dry amphiphilic biodegradable and biocompatible block-copolymer obtained via the combination of the reversible additionâ€“fragmentation chain transfer polymerization and ring-opening polymerization. In this way, a novel paclitaxel formulation with the same drug pharmacological properties, but without the use of the Cremophor EL, can be produced. In addition, as long as these nanoparticles are engineered to act as solubility enhancers, a lower burden for its approval from the pharmaceutical regulatory agencies is also expected."
