  abstract: “A novel deep learning  technique called Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is adapted to study steady groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers. This technique utilizes information from underlying physics represented in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) alongside data obtained from physical observations. In this work, we consider the Dupuit-Boussinesq equation, which is based on the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation, as well as a recent more complete model derived by Di Nucci (2018) as underlying models. We then train PINNs on data obtained from steady-state analytical solutions and laboratory based experiments."

  abstract: The fifth-order finite-volume WENO-C reconstruction scheme is proposed for structured grids in cylindrical coordinates to achieve high order spatial accuracy along with ENO transition. A grid independent smoothness indicator is derived for this scheme. For uniform grids, the analytical values in cylindrical-radial coordinates for the limiting case (R → ∞) conform to WENO-JS. Linear stability analysis of the present scheme is performed using a scalar advection equation in radial coordinates. Several tests involving smooth and discontinuous flows are performed, which testify for the fifth-order accuracy and ENO property of the scheme."
