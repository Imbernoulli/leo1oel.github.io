  abstract: The fifth-order finite-volume WENO-C reconstruction scheme is proposed for structured grids in cylindrical coordinates to achieve high order spatial accuracy along with ENO transition. A grid independent smoothness indicator is derived for this scheme. For uniform grids, the analytical values in cylindrical-radial coordinates for the limiting case (R → ∞) conform to WENO-JS. Linear stability analysis of the present scheme is performed using a scalar advection equation in radial coordinates. Several tests involving smooth and discontinuous flows are performed, which testify for the fifth-order accuracy and ENO property of the scheme."
