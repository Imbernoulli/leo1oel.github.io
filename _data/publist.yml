  abstract: The improvement of the pharmacological profile of lipophilic drug formulations is one of the main successes achieved using nanoparticles (NPs) in medicine. However, the complex synthesis procedure and numerous post-processing steps hamper the cost-effective use of these formulations. In this work, an approach which requires only a syringe to produce self-assembling biodegradable and biocompatible poly(caprolactone)-based NPs is developed. The effective synthesis of monodisperse NPs has been made possible by the optimization of the block-copolymer synthesized via a combination of ring opening polymerization and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. These NPs can be used to formulate lipophilic drugs that are barely soluble in water, such as trabectedin, a potent anticancer therapeutic. Its biodistribution and antitumor activity have been compared with the commercially available formulation Yondelis®. The results indicate that this trabectedin NP formulation performs with the same antitumor activity as Yondelis®, but does not have the drawback of severe local vascular toxicity in the injection site.

  abstract: The possibility to control the fate of the cells responsible for secondary mechanisms following spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most relevant challenges to reduce the post traumatic degeneration of the spinal cord. In particular, microglia/macrophages associated inflammation appears to be a self-propelling mechanism which leads to progressive neurodegeneration and development of persisting pain state. In this study we analyzed the interactions between poly(methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles (PMMA-NPs) and microglia/macrophages in vitro and in vivo, characterizing the features that influence their internalization and ability to deliver drugs. The uptake mechanisms of PMMA-NPs were in-depth investigated, together with their possible toxic effects on microglia/macrophages. In addition, the possibility to deliver a mimetic drug within microglia/macrophages was characterized in vitro and in vivo. Drug-loaded polymeric NPs resulted to be a promising tool for the selective administration of pharmacological compounds in activated microglia/macrophages and thus potentially able to counteract relevant secondary inflammatory events in SCI.
