### Welcome!

Fluid mechanics spans diverse fields of science and engineering. I like to think myself as a fluids enthusiast who aspires to become a **computational scientist** and hopes to solve real-world problems via mathematical modeling and numerical methods.
In the past, I have had the pleasure to work in diverse fields of fluid mechanics and numerical methods such as <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/shadab_fifthWENO_CnF_2019.pdf" target="_blank">high order methods</a>, laminar & turbulent combustion, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/shadab_Scramjet_2017.pdf" target="_blank">hypersonic flows</a>, 
and <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD20/Session/S03.3" target="_blank">viscoelastic fluids</a>.
Currently, I am investigating multiple fluid flow problems in earth and plantary sciences such as **firn densification due to melt percolation** as a part of the *University of Texas Institute for Geophysics Graduate Student fellowship* 
and **melt percolation during core formation in planetesimals** through *NASA Emerging World Grant* project. I am also collaborating with Eric Hiatt from Jackson School of Geosciences to investigate the **<a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/webprogram/Paper712914.html" target="_blank">post-impact hydrothermal systems on early Mars</a>**.
Recent examples include the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/bryngelson-IJMF-20.pdf" target="_blank">most efficient sub-grid model</a>.

### About me

I am a Senior Postdoctoral Scholar at the California Institute of Technology, working with <a href="https://www.colonius.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Professor Tim Colonius</a>.
I also work with <a href="http://sandlab.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Professor Themis Sapsis</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on machine-learned model closures.
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://xpacc.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Exascale Simulation of Plasma-Coupled Combustion</a> (XPACC).
I have a Ph.D. and M.S. in <a href="https://mechanical.illinois.edu/graduate/graduate-degree-programs/phd-programs/phd-theoretical-and-applied-mechanics" target="_blank">Theoretical and Applied Mechanics</a> from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (2017 and 2015), where I worked with <a href="https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jbfreund" target="_blank">Professor Jonathan Freund</a>.
I hold B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Michigan–Dearborn (2013).
